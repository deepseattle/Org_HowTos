# Hierarchy And Sustainability

This document describes a basic hierarchy to the Seattle Deep Learning Meetup group. 
The idea is to create an organizational structure that allows this meetup group to 
sustain itself over time and through various leadership positional changes. It
encourages participants to move up to organizers and for organizers to relinquish
their responsibilities and become regular participants, passing to torch to next generations. 

## Chart

* Founders
  * Organizers
    * Project Leads
      * Projects in the works potential leads
        * Participants


## Current Leadership

Founders (Benevolent Dictators for Life): Ben Bastian & Adam Cox
Organizers: Ben Bastian, Adam Cox, Don Alvarez
Project Leads: Rebecca Holiday, Adam Cox, Jaime Espinosa, Adnan Siddqui
In the works: Guarav Avora, Abhishek Patnia


## Responibilies

* BDFL: Final Say
* Organizers: Secure meetup locations, foster new projects, find speakers (project updates or mini "tech talks")
* Project Leads: manager their project
* Projects in the works: explore viability of project
* Participants: have fun and do good work


## Cyclical Flow

We aim to flow participants up the chain all the way to 'Organizer' and then let organizers
return to general participants. 

For example, the current set of Project Leaders are invited to become Organizers once their
projects are completed. 

Although, this is by no means a hard and fast rule. We'll take organizational help from those that haven't been
project leads. And, of course, 'Organizers' can simultaneously be participants in projects.

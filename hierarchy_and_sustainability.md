# Hierarchy And Sustainability

This document describes a basic hierarchy to the Seattle Deep Learning Meetup group. 
The idea is to create an organizational structure that allows this meetup group to 
sustain itself over time and through various leadership positional changes. It
encourages participants to move up to organizers and for organizers to relinquish
their responsibilities and become regular participants, passing to torch to next generations. 

## Chart

* Founders
  * Organizers
      * General Organizer
      * Speaker Czar
      * Github Admin
    * Project Leads
      * Projects in the works potential leads
        * Participants


## Current Leadership

Founders (Benevolent Dictators for Life): Ben Bastian & Adam Cox

Organizers: Ben Bastian, Adam Cox, Don Alvarez (Speaker Czar)

Project Leads: Rebecca Holiday, Adam Cox, Jaime Espinosa, Adnan Siddqui

In the works: Guarav Avora, Abhishek Patnia


## Responsibilities

* BDFL: Final Say
* Organizers: Secure meetup locations, foster new projects, find speakers (project updates or mini "tech talks"), archive presentations, manage Meetup announcements, manage Slack, manage github repositories.
* Project Leads: manage their project
* Projects in the works: explore viability of project
* Participants: have fun and do good work


## Cyclical Flow

We aim to flow participants up the chain all the way to 'Organizer' and then let organizers
return to general participants. 

For example, the current set of Project Leaders are invited to become Organizers once their
projects are completed. Participants are encouraged to start their own projects and become project leads.

Although, this is by no means a hard and fast rule. We'll take organizational help from those that haven't been
project leads. And, of course, 'Organizers' can simultaneously be participants in projects.

# Guide New Project

These HowTo notes are for Organizers in the Seattle Deep Learning Meetup. They 
are to help you form new projects, listing out all the steps that will help it be successful.  

1. Get project idea from members.
  * Organizers need to vet the idea to ensure high quality projects.
2. Identify project lead.
3. Add project to the ‘in the works’ section of "projects" repository if that project needs to explore the idea more and find members if leader is unsure to start.
4. Project lead needs to create project markdown file and issue pull request to add file to "projects" repository. 
  * the markdown file should include
  * outline of project in as much detail as necessary
  * start date and proposed schedule (start date should coincide with or be immediately after pitch at next Meetup)
  * have an idea of where project group might meet on a ~weekly basis
5. Organizer should create project channel on Slack.
5. Project lead should send out one @channel message to #general on Slack to announce project.
6. Organizers should send out one email to entire group on Meetup, preferably along with announcements of other projects to keep spam to minimum.
7. Project lead should prepare to give 5 minute pitch at next available Meetup.
8. Project lead should have an idea of what to do at their first meeting to organize members. Such organizational tasks include
  * review schedule and goals
  * time and location for meetings
  * project tasks and identify those willing to be responsible for tasks
